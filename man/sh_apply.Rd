\title{Apply a scoring method to each participant using full or split data set}
\usage{
sh_apply(ds, participant_id, fn_sets, fn_score, split_count = 0,
  show_progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ds}{(data frame) data frame containing data to score.}

\item{participant_id}{(character) name of column that identifies participants in ds.}

\item{fn_sets}{(function) receives data from a single participant, should return a list of sets that may be split. Elements of sets that are data frames are split by row. Elements of sets that are lists or vectors are split by element.}

\item{fn_score}{(function) receives full or split sets, should return a single number.}

\item{split_count}{(numeric) Default: 0. If 0, applies fn_score on full set. If > 0, applies fn_score to split sets, split_count times.}

\item{show_progress}{(logical) Default: TRUE If TRUE, prints current split number each split.}
}
\value{
(data frame) If split_count == 0, applies fn_score result on full data and returns a data frame with a column for participant_id and a column named "score" for fn_score applied to the full data of a participant. If split_count > 0, applies fn_score on full data and returns data frame with a column for participant_id, a column "split" that counts splits, and "score_1" and "score_2" for fn_score applied to each split.
