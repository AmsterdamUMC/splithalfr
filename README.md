# splithalfr: Extensible Bootstrapped Split-half Reliabilities
Calculates scores and bootstrapped split-half reliabilities for reaction time (RT) tasks and questionnaires. 
The splithalfr can be extended by custom scoring methods for user-provided datasets.

## Vignettes and Tests
The splithalfr vignettes demonstrate how to write a custom scoring method based on a set of common questionnaire and RT task scoring methods, using included example datasets.
The code included in each vignette also serves as a test of correct functioning of the splithalfr, by comparing the splithalfr score for a single participant with the same score calculated via Excel. 
The materials for each test can be found in the "tests" directory.
